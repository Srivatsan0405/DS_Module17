## DATE: 25.04.2025
## AIM:

## Algorithm
1. Start
2. Create the graph using create_graph() function.
3. Calculate the indegree for each vertex. If the indegree is 0, insert the vertex into the queue.
4. Initialize count to 0 and begin processing vertices from the queue.
5. Dequeue a vertex, add it to the topo_order array, and remove all its outgoing edges.
6. For each adjacent vertex, decrease its indegree. If the indegree becomes 0, enqueue it.
7. If there is a cycle (i.e., not all vertices are processed), print an error message and exit.
8. Print the vertices in topological order.
9. End
10.

## Result:
Thus, the C program for determining whether the topological ordering for the following graph is possible or not, is implemented successfully.
